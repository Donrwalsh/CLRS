# CLRS

This repository contains my solutions for exercises and problems from [Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms). It is a sub-site of my [portfolio](https://github.com/Donrwalsh/donrwalsh.github.io) which is hosted on github pages: [CLRS](https://donrwalsh.github.io/CLRS/).

## Deployment ##

The included Gemfile is intended to emulate the github pages environment, so local deploy should be done with the following command:

`bundle exec jekyll serve JEKYLL_ENV=development`

## Methodology ##

As a self-taught developer, working through this textbook is in an effort to close knowledge-gaps that come from a lack of formal training. I am studying this textbook in a self-directed manner and thus rely on publicly available solutions and materials to expand upon and verify my understanding of topics discussed in the text. I make every effort to ensure my solutions are accurate based on my understanding of the material, but make no strong claim that they are 100% accurate and without misconceptions. That being said, if you find an error in one of my solutions I would love to hear about it!
