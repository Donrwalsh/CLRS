>Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Human memory. Incredible ability to recall specific information on demand, but practically incapable of accurately describing it in its entirety (Have you seen this movie versus tell me every movie you've seen). Subject to unreliable precision as well as deterioration over time.

Based on what I'm seeing in other solutions online, this question is looking for a discussion of legitimate data structures in computer science. In my research I found https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/ to be an exceptional resource.

**Arrays**

Strengths:

- Represent many values by way of a single variable.
- Retreiving values by index is efficient.
- Arrays are of fixed size and use just enough storage as is necessary.

Weaknesses:

- Contained data must be of the same type.
- We must know in advance the desired size of an array.
- Immutable: Adding or removing elements requires recreation.
