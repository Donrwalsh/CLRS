>Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

On my phone, I have a list of contacts. I am able to sort this list by names (first or last), date added, date used, birthday and more. This application must include some sort of sorting algorithm as another user may have an entirely different list of contacts, but would need them to be sorted quickly just the same as me.
