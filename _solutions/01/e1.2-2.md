>Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $$n$$, insertion sort runs in $$8n^2$$ steps, while merge sort runs in $$64n \lg n$$ steps. For which values of $$n$$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?

First of all, $$8n^2 < 64n \lg n$$ reduces to $$n < 8 \lg n$$. Next I used **sort_compare.py** to determine when merge sort overtakes insertion sort, which occurs at $$n = 44$$. Merge sort is also more effective when $$n = 1$$. Therefore, insertion sort beats merge sort when $$1 \lt n \leq 43$$.

**sort_compare.py:**

{% highlight python %}
import math

n = 2
while True:
    if n < 8 * math.log2(n):
        print("for n = " + str(n) + ", insertion sort beats merge sort")
    else:
        print("for n = " + str(n) + ", merge sort wins!")
        break
    n += 1
{% endhighlight %}
