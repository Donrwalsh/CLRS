>What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is $$100n^2$$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $$2n$$ on the same machine?

I wrote `algorithm_compare.py` to calculate that the lowest value of $$n$$ that satisfies this condition is 15.

**algorithm_compare.py:**

{% highlight python %}
def run_time_01(n):
    return 100 * n ** 2


def run_time_02(n):
    return 2 ** n


n = 2
while True:
    if run_time_01(n) < run_time_02(n):
        print("Lowest value of n is " + str(n))
        break
    else:
        n += 1
{% endhighlight %}
