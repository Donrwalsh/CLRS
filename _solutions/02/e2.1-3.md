>Consider the ***searching problem***:
>
>**Input**: A sequence of n numbers $$A = \langle a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \rangle$$ and a value $$v$$.
>
>**Output**: An index $$i$$ such that $$v = A[i]$$ or the special value NIL if $$v$$ does not appear in $$A$$.
>
>Write pseudocode for ***linear search***, which scans through the sequence, looking for $$v$$. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)

1 `i = NIL`

2 `for j = 1 to A.length`:

3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `if A[j] == v`:

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `i = j`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `break`

6 `return i`

*Loop Invariant*: At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2-5, the subarray $$A \langle 1, ... j-1 \rangle$$ consists of elements that are not $$v$$.

**Initialization**: At initialization, the subarray contains no elements, therefore it does not contain $$v$$.

**Maintenance**: We already know that $$A \langle 1, ... j-1 \rangle$$ does not contain $$v$$. We then check to see if the element $$A[j]$$ is $$v$$ and assign it to the variable $$i$$ if it does. We also break the for loop in this case, and will then return $$i$$ which is the index of where $$v$$ appears in $$A$$. Otherwise, we continue to the next iteration of the loop and because we did not find $$v$$ at position $$j$$, the resulting array still does not contain $$v$$ which means the invariant holds.

**Termination**: The loop will terminate when $$j$$ is greater than the length of $$A$$. Since we are incrementing $$j$$ by 1, we have thus examined each element of $$A$$ and determined that none of them contain $$v$$, in which case we return NIL.
