>We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort $$A[1..n]$$, we recursively sort $$A[1..n-1]$$ and then insert $$A[n]$$ into the sorted array $$A[1..n-1]$$. Write a recurrence for the worst-case running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

Our division of the problem yields 1 subproblem of size $$\frac{n}{n-1}$$. Dividing the problem takes constant $$\Theta(1)$$ time, whereas solving it in the worst case takes $$\Theta(n-1)$$ time. Using our recurrence calculation (pg.35):

$$
 T(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    \Theta(1) & \text{if $n=1$} \\
    T(n-1) + \Theta(n) & \text{if $n>1$} \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
