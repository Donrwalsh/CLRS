>Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence $$A$$ is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against $$v$$ and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The ***binary search*** algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $$\Theta(\lg n)$$.

BINARY-SEARCH(A, v)

1 `i = 0`

2 `j = ceiling(A.length/2)`

3 `if A[j] = v { i += j }`

4 `else if A[j] < v { i += j + BINARY-SEARCH(A[j + 1,...,n]) }`

5 `else if A[j] > v { i += BINARY-SEARCH(A[1,...,j - 1]) }`

6 `return i`

Intuitively, the worst-case scenrio for BINARY-SEARCH is when $$v$$ does not exist in $$A$$ at all. In which case we halve the array as many times as possible, which takes $$\Theta(\lg n)$$.
