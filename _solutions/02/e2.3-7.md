>Describe a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$-time algorithm that, given a set $$S$$ of $$n$$ integers and another integer $$x$$, determines whether or not there exist two elements in $$S$$ whose sum is exactly $$x$$.

Firstly we sort $$S$$ by way of MERGE-SORT which takes $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time. We then iterate over our sorted array and use BINARY-SEARCH to determine if the integer that would sum to $$x$$. BINARY-SEARCH takes $$\Theta(\lg n)$$ time and doing it $$n$$ times takes $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time. Since both these steps take $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time, combining the two of them is the same as multiplying that time by a constant factor. Therefore this algorithm runs at $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time.
