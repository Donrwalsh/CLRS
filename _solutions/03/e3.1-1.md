>Let $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of $$\Theta$$-notation, prove that $$\max(f(n),g(n)) = \Theta(f(n) + g(n))$$.

$$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ being asympototically nonnegative functions means that $$0 \leq f(n)$$ and $$0 \leq g(n)$$ which implies:

$$0 \leq f(n) + g(n)$$

Taking the max of two integers results in one of those two values which gives us $$f(n) \leq \max(f(n), g(n))$$ and $$g(n) \leq \max(f(n), g(n))$$ and happens to imply $$\frac{f(n) + g(n)}{2} \leq \max(f(n), g(n))$$. We can combine this with our above inequality by first multiplying both sides by $$\frac{1}{2}$$:

$$0 \leq \frac{f(n) + g(n)}{2} \leq \max(f(n), g(n))$$

Lastly, $$\max(f(n), g(n))$$ is always less than or equal to the sum of its two terms (since we know they are not negative). This tells us $$\max(f(n), g(n)) \leq f(n) + g(n)$$. This gives us the following inequality:

$$0 \leq \frac{f(n) + g(n)}{2} \leq \max(f(n), g(n)) \leq f(n) + g(n)$$

Which is the definition of $$\Theta$$-notation with $$c_1 = \frac{1}{2}$$ and $$c_2 = 1$$.
