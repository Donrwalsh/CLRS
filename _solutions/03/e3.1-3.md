>Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm $$A$$ is at least $$O(n^2)$$," is meaningless.

$$T(n)$$ is the running time of algorithm $$A$$. The statement above is saying that $$T(n) \geq O(n^2)$$ which does not tell us enough to specify the upper-bound of $$T(n)$$. Furthermore, even if the statement were more specific and told us that $$A = O(n^2)$$ that still wouldn't be enough to determine the lower-bound of $$T(n)$$ since it could be any function that grows slower than $$n^2$$. Ultimately this statement is describing an infinite set of functions and is therefore meaningless.
