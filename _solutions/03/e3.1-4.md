>Is $$2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$$? 

In order for this statement to be true, it must be true that there exist positive constants $$c$$ and $$n_0$$ such that

$$0 \leq 2^{n+1} \leq c2^n \ \forall \ n > n_0$$

By reducing this inequality it is apparent that selecting any $$c \geq 2$$ will make this inequality hold for all $$n > 0$$. So the statement $$2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$$ is true.

>Is $$2^{2n} = O(2^n)$$?

In order for this statement to be true, it must be true that there exist positive constants $$c$$ and $$n_0$$ such that

$$0 \leq 2^{2n} \leq c2^n \ \forall \ n > n_0$$

Reducing this inequality yields $$0 \leq 2^n \leq c$$. We cannot choose a positive value for $$c$$ that satisfies this inequality since $$2^n$$ will eventually overtake any selected constant. So the statement $$2^{2n} = O(2^n)$$ is false.
