>For any two functions $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$, we have $$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$$ if and only if $$f(n) = O(g(n)$$) and $$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$$.

Suppose $$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$$. Then, by definition there exist positive constants $$c_1$$, $$c_2$$, and $$n_0$$ such that $$0 \leq c_1g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2g(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_0$$. Due to the existence of $$c_1$$ and $$n_0$$, it is true that $$0 \leq c_1g(n) \leq f(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_0 \implies f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$$. Likewise the existence of $$c_2$$ and $$n_0$$ make it true that $$0 \leq f(n) \leq c_2g(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_0 \implies f(n) = O(g(n))$$.

That being said, the "if and only if" wording means we must also prove that the inverse holds as well.

Suppose $$f(n) = O(g(n))$$ and $$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$$. Then, by definition there exist positive constants $$c_a$$, $$c_b$$, $$n_{a}$$ and $$n_{b}$$ such that:

$$0 \leq c_ag(n) \leq f(n) \ \forall \ n > n_a$$

$$0 \leq f(n) \leq c_bg(n) \ \forall \ n > n_b$$

By setting $$n_c = \max(n_a, n_b)$$ we can combine these two inequalities:

$$0 \leq c_ag(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_bg(n) \ \forall \ n > n_c \implies f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$$
