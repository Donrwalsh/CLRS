>Prove that the running time of an algorithm is $$\Theta(g(n))$$ if and only if its worst-case running time is $$O(g(n))$$ and its best-case running time is $$\Omega(g(n))$$.

Mathematically proving this boils down to the same work done in [Exercise 3.1-5](/solutions/03/e3.1-5) since this statement also relies on Theorem 3.1. What follows is an informal explanation of why this statement is true.

Suppose $$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$$ and that $$f_w(n)$$ and $$f_b(n)$$ indicate the worst-case and best-case runtimes of $$f(n)$$ respectively. Based on Thereom 3.1 we know that $$f(n) = O(g(n))$$ and $$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$$.

Saying $$f(n)$$ has an upper-bound represented by $$O(g(n))$$ is the same as saying that in the worst-case, $$f(n)$$ will not exceed $$O(g(n))$$. This indicates that $$f_w(n) = O(g(n))$$. Similar logic can be used to describe that $$f_b(n) = \Omega(g(n))$$.

The key here is that $$f(n)$$ is the set of all functions that include and lie between $$f_w(n)$$ and $$f_b(n)$$. The usage of $$\Theta$$, $$O$$ and $$\Omega$$-notation is a mathematically rigorous way of describing the area this set of functions is bound by with the worst-case run time defining the upper-bound and the best-case run time defining the lower bound.

If we suppose instead that $$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$$ and that, say, $$f_w(n) \neq O(g(n))$$ then we are saying that $$f_w(n)$$ exceeds the upper-bound represented by $$O(g(n))$$ which in turn implies that $$f(n)$$ also exceeds the upper-bound represented by $$\Theta(g(n))$$ since $$f_w(n)$$ a possible run-time of $$f(n)$$. This is clearly a contradiction, and the same argument applies to making the claim that $$f_b(n) \neq \Omega(g(n))$$.
