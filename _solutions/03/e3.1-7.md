>Prove that $$o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$$ is the empty set.

$$o(g(n))$$ implies that for any positive constant $$c > 0$$, there exists a constant $$n_a > 0$$ such that $$0 \leq f(n) < cg(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_a$$. Likewise, $$\omega(g(n))$$ implies that for any positive constant $$c > 0$$, there exists a constant $$n_b > 0$$ such that $$0 \leq cg(n) < f(n) \ \forall \ n \geq n_b$$.

In order to find $$o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$$ we must combine these two inequalities, so we have:

$$ 0 \leq cg(n) < f(n) < cg(n) \ \forall \ n > \max(n_a, n_b)$$

This inequality has no solution, and therefore $$o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$$ is the empty set.
