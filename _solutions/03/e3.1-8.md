>We can extend our notation to the case of two parameters $$n$$ and $$m$$ that can go to infinity independently at different rates. For a given function $$g(n,m)$$, we denote by $$O(g(n,m))$$ the set of functions
>
>$$O(g(n,m)) = \{f(n,m):$$ there exist positive constants $$c$$, $$n_0$$, and $$m_0$$ such that  $$0 \leq f(n,m) \leq cg(n,m)$$ for all $$n \geq n_0$$ or $$m \geq m_0 \}$$.

>Give corresponding definitions for $$\Omega(g(n,m))$$ and $$\Theta(g(n,m))$$.

$$\Omega(g(n,m)) = \{ f(n,m):$$ there exist positive constants $$c$$, $$n_0$$, and $$m_0$$ such that $$0 \leq cg(n,m) \leq f(n,m)$$ for all $$n \geq n_0$$ or $$m \geq m_0 \}$$.

$$\Theta(g(n,m)) = \{ f(n,m):$$ there exist positive constants $$c_1$$, $$c_2$$, $$n_0$$, and $$m_0$$ such that $$0 \leq c_1g(n,m) \leq f(n,m) \leq c_2g(n,m)$$ for all $$n \geq n_0$$ or $$m \geq m_0 \}$$.
