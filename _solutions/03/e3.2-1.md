>Show that if $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ are monotonically increasing functions, then so are the functions $$f(n) + g(n)$$ and $$f(g(n))$$, and if $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ are in addition nonnegative, then $$f(n) \cdot g(n)$$ is monotonically increasing.

$$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ being monotonically inceasing functions tells us that $$m \leq n \implies f(m) \leq f(n)$$ and $$g(m) \leq g(n)$$. We are able to combine these two inequalities as $$f(m) + g(m) \leq f(n) + g(n)$$ which tells us that $$f(n) + g(n)$$ is also monotonically increasing.

Because $$m \leq n \implies g(m) \leq g(n)$$ then we also know that $$f(g(m)) \leq f(g(n))$$ which tells us that $$f(g(n))$$ is monotonically increasing as well.

If $$f(n) \geq 0$$ and $$g(n) \geq 0 \ \forall \ n$$ then we are also able to multiply the inequalities as $$f(m) \cdot g(m) \leq f(n) \cdot g(n)$$ which demonstrates that $$f(n) \cdot g(n)$$ is monotonically increasing if both functions are nonnegative.
