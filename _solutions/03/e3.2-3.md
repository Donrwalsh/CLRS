>Prove $$\lg(n!) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$. Also prove that $$n! = \omega(2^n)$$ and $$n! = o(n^n)$$.

Using Stirling's Approximation:

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
n! & = \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \left(1 + \Theta \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right) \\
\lg(n!) & = \lg(\sqrt{2 \pi n}) + \lg \left( \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \right) + \lg \left(1 + \Theta \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right) \\
& =  \Theta(\sqrt{n}) + n \lg \left( \frac{n}{e} \right) + lg\left(\Theta(1) + \Theta \left(\frac{1}{n} \right) \right) \\
& = \Theta(n) + \Theta(n \lg n) + \Theta \left(\frac{1}{n} \right)\\
& = \Theta(n \lg n) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$

In order to prove $$n! = \omega(2^n)$$ we must show that for any positive constant $$c > 0$$, there exists a constant $$n_0 > 0$$ such that $$0 \leq c2^n < n! \ \forall \ n \geq n_0$$. In order to satisfy this inequality, we must find the point at which $$n!$$ overtakes $$2^n$$ which occurs when $$n /geq 4$$ so then by setting $$n_0 = 4c$$ we conclude that $$n! = \omega(2^n)$$.

In order to prove $$n! = o(n^n)$$ we must show that for any positive constant $$c > 0$$, there exists a constant $$n_0 > 0$$ such that $$0 \leq n! < cn^n \ \forall \ n \geq n_0$$. In order to satisfy this inequality, we must find the point at which $$n^n$$ overtakes $$n!$$ which occurs when $$n \geq 2$$ so then by setting $$n_0 = 2c$$ we conclude that $$n! = o(n^n)$$.
