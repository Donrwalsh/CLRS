>Which is asymptotically larger: $$\lg(\lg^* n)$$ or $$\lg^*(\lg n)$$?

Setting $$x = \lg^* n$$ gives us $$\lg(\lg^* n) = \lg x$$. It also gives us $$\lg^*(\lg n) = x - 1$$ because the inner logarithm of $$\lg^*(\lg n)$$ reduces the output of the iterated logarithm by 1.

Because $$x - 1$$ is asymptotically larger than $$\lg(x)$$, $$\lg^*(\lg n)$$ is also asymptotically larger than $$\lg(\lg^* n)$$.
