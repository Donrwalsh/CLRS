>We can apply the iteration operator $${}^*$$ used in the $$\lg^*$$ function to any monotonically increasing function $$f(n)$$ over the reals. For a given constant $$c \in \mathbb{R}$$, we define the iterated function $$f^*_c(n)$$ by

***c.*** and ***d.*** evaluate out to $$\lg (n) + 1$$ and $$\lg (n)$$ respectively, both of which are bound by $$\Theta(\lg(n))$$

In order to solve ***e.*** suppose we have some integer $$m_i$$ which is found in the sequence $$\{2, 4, 16, 256, ... \}$$. This can be written as $$\{2^{2^0}, 2^{2^1}, 2^{2^3},... \}$$ so then $$m_i = 2^{2^i}$$. The smallest $$m_i$$ that is greater than or equal to $$n$$ suggests that our solution to $$f^*_c(n) = i$$ because we must apply $$\sqrt{n}$$ to $$n$$ $$i$$ times before our result is $$\leq 2$$. Handily, $$\lg(\lg(n)) = i$$ works because $$n = 2^{2^i}$$ as well, therefore $$\Theta(\lg(\lg(n)))$$ is a tight bound for our solution.

***f.*** has no solution because we cannot reach $$1$$ by square-rooting an integer (unless that integer is also $$1$$).

We can solve ***g.*** by using similar logic. Suppose we have some integer $$p_i$$ which is found in the sequence $$\{2, 8, 512, (134,217,728), ... \}$$ = $$\{2^{3^0}, 2^{3^1}, 2^{3^2},... \}$$ so then $$p_i = 2^{3^i}$$. The smallest $$p_i$$ that is greater than or equal to $$n$$ suggests our solution to $$f^*_c(n) = i$$. In order to account for the exponent term change, we tweak our solution to be $$\log_3(\lg(n)) = i$$ which applies here because $$n = 2^{3^i}$$, therefore $$\Theta(\log_3(\lg(n))$$ is a tight bound for our solution.

***h.*** does not neatly calculate out into an equation that is a tightly bound, and $$\Omega(\lg(n) / \lg(\lg(n)))$$ is one of the only possible solutions I found that comes close as a representation of this function's $$f^*_c$$.
