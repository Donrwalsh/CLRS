>Implement both the brute-force and recursive algorithms for the maximum subarray problem on your own computer. What problem size $$n_0$$ gives the crossover point at which the recursive algorithm beats the brute-force algorithm? Then, change the base case of the recursive algorithm to use the brute-force algorithm whenever the problem size is less than $$n_0$$. Does that change the crossover point?

I have included python code that I used to implement both versions of this algorithm and compare their running times. I found $$n_0$$ to be roughly $$70$$, but it varied quite a bit. When I made a change to the base case to invoke brute-force when the array size was less than $$70$$, it change the crossover point quite a bit in that recursive no longer beat brute-force even for very high values of $$n$$. However when I made the change to the base case to use brute force for problem sizes that were greater than $$70$$ the result was brute-force and recursive being very close in runtime such that it almost seemed random which would win out on the other one.
