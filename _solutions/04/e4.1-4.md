>Suppose we change the definition of the maximum-subarray problem to allow the result to be an empty subarray, where the sum of the values of an empty subarray is $$0$$. How would you change any of the algorithms that do not allow empty subarrays to permit an empty subarray to be the result?

The quick-and-dirty way of doing this would be to have the algorithm return an empty subarray whenever it would otherwise return a subarray with a sum that is negative. Setting the initial sum to $$0$$ rather than an arbitrarily small number would work as well.
