>Write pseudocode for Strassen's algorithm.

Up until this point in the text, we've been working off the simplifying assumption that our input matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$ are $$2^i \times 2^i$$ for some positive integer $$i$$ which means the same is true of all $$S$$ and $$P$$ matrices (although their size is $$2^{i-1} \times 2^{i-1}$$ where $$i$$ may be $$0$$). The following pseudocode is written with this assumption in mind, as well as if $$C$$ were a $$2 \times 2$$ matrix though this may not be the case.

Nevertheless, in steps 24-27 when we are assigning values to $$C$$, the fact that $$C$$ is of size $$n \times n$$ and our various $$P$$ and $$S$$ matrices are of size $$\frac{n}{2} \times \frac{n}{2}$$ means we can pattern the assignments to four quadrants of $$C$$ much like we would if $$C$$ were in fact a $$2 \times 2$$ matrix. The specific mechanics of how this would be expressed by pseudocode for a matrix $$C$$ of variable size did not seem relevant to the task at hand and so I decided to skip the additional effort since this exercise is already quite tedious.

STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(A, B)

01 `n = A.rows`

02 `let C be a new n x n matrix`

03 `if n == 1`

04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `C₁₁ = A₁₁ · B₁₁`

05 `else partition A, B, and C as in equations (4.9)`

06 `let S₁, S₂, S₃, S₄, S₅, S₆, S₇, S₈, S₉, S₁₀, P₁, P₂, P₃, P₄, P₅, P₆ and P₇ be new n/2 x n/2 matrices`

07 `S₁ = B₁₂ - B₂₂`

08 `S₂ = A₁₁ + A₁₂`

09 `S₃ = A₂₁ + A₂₂`

10 `S₄ = B₂₁ - B₁₁`

11 `S₅ = A₁₁ + A₂₂`

12 `S₆ = B₁₁ + B₂₂`

13 `S₇ = A₁₂ - A₂₂`

14 `S₈ = B₂₁ + B₂₂`

15 `S₉ = A₁₁ - A₂₁`

16 `S₁₀ = B₁₁ + B₁₂`

17 `P₁ = STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(A₁₁, S₁)`

18 `P₂ = STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(S₂, B₂₂)`

19 `P₃ = STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(S₃, B₁₁)`

20 `P₄ = STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(A₂₂, S₄)`

21 `P₅ = STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(S₅, S₆)`

22 `P₆ = STRASSEN-ALGORITHM(S₇, S₈)`

28 `return C`
