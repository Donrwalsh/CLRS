>How would you modify Strassen's algorithm to multiply $$n \times n$$ matrices in which $$n$$ is not an exact power of $$2$$? Show that the resulting algorithm runs in time $$\Theta(n^{\lg 7})$$.

Given $$n$$ which is not an exact power of $$2$$, let $$m$$ be the next highest power of $$2$$, which is to say $$m = 2^{\lceil( \lg n \rceil)}$$. We can modify our original $$n \times n$$ input matrices to be $$m \times m$$ by padding them with $$m-n$$ zeroes. We then perform Strassen's algorithm on the two $$m \times m$$ matrices and gives us an output that similarly has $$m-n$$ padded rows and columns which we then remove.

Adding and removing the padding zeroes to the matrices is an action that is performed twice and it takes $$O(m^2)$$ time both times. The algorithm therefore runs in $$\Theta(m^{\lg 7}) + O(m^2) = \Theta(m^{\lg 7})$$ time. We also know that $$n \geq m < 2^{(\lg n) + 1} = 2^{\lg n} \cdot 2 = 2n$$ which means our algorithm runs in $$\Theta((2n)^{\lg 7}) = \Theta(n^{\lg 7})$$ time.
