>What is the largest $$k$$ such that if you can multiply $$3 \times 3$$ matrices using $$k$$ multiplications (not assuming commutativity of multiplication), then you can multiply $$n \times n$$ matrices in time $$o(n^{\lg 7})$$? What would the running time of this algorithm be?

This question is describing a form of the SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE algorithm that divides its input matrices into $$n/3 \times n/3$$ submatrices. This new algorithm is represented by the following recurrence:

$$\begin{split}
T(n) & = \Theta(1) + 27T(n/3) + \Theta(n^2) \\
& = 27T(n/3) + \Theta(n^2) \\
\end{split}$$

Supposing we can use a strategy similar to Strassen's wherein we perform $$k$$ multiplications instead of 27, we would instead be looking at the recurrence:

$$T(n) = kT(n/3) + \Theta(n^2)$$

Which we can solve using the 1st case of the master theorem. Let $$a = k$$, $$b = 3$$ and $$f(n) = n^2$$. Then $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_3k-\epsilon})$$ holds for $$0 < \epsilon \leq \log_3k - 2$$ where $$\log_3k > 2$$. Therefore $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_3k})$$. 

Via trial and error with graphing, the largest $$k$$ such that $$\log_3k < \log 7$$ is $$21$$.
