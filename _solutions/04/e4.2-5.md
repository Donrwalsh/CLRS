>V. Pan has discovered a way of multiplying $$68 \times 68$$ matrices using $$132,464$$ multiplications, a way of multiplying $$70 \times 70$$ matrices using $$143,640$$ multiplications, and a way of multiplying $$72 \times 72$$ matrices using $$155,424$$ multiplications. Which method yields the best asymptotic running time when used in a divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithm? How does it compare to Strassen's algorithm?

By applying the same technique as in Exercise 4.2-4 we are looking for the smallest value of the following:

$$\begin{split}
n^{\log_{68}132,464} & = n^{2.7951284873614} \\
n^{\log_{70}143,640} & = n^{2.7951226897483} \\
n^{\log_{72}155,424} & = n^{2.7951473910934} \\
\end{split}$$

Therefore the fastest algorithm is the on that multiplies $$70 \times 70$$ matrices in $$143,640$$ multiplications. Since Strassen's algorith runs in $$\Theta(n^{2.8073549220576})$$ time, all three of these algorithms will outperform it.
