>How quickly can you multiply a $$kn \times n$$ matrix by an $$n \times kn$$ matrix, using Strassen's algorithm as a subroutine? Answer the same question with the order of the input matrices reversed.

Suppose $$A$$ is a $$kn \times n$$ matrix and $$B$$ is a $$n \times kn$$ matrix. In other words, $$A = \begin {bmatrix} 
A_1 \\ 
\vdots \\ 
A_k \end {bmatrix}$$ and $$B = 
\begin {bmatrix} B_1 \cdots B_k \end {bmatrix}$$ where each $$A_i$$ and $$B_i$$ is a $$n \times n$$ matrix. Their product $$C$$ is a $$kn \times kn$$ matrix of the form $$\begin {bmatrix} A_1B_1 & \cdots & A_1B_k \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ A_kB_1 & \cdots & A_kB_k \end{bmatrix}$$ and we can use Strassen's algorithm to compute each term of this matrix. Since there are $$k^2$$ terms to compute via Strassen's algorithm, we know that this will take $$\Theta(k^2 n^{\lg7})$$ time. 

Computing $$B \cdot A$$ will result in an $$n \times n$$ matrix which we calculate as $$C = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}B_{i} \cdot A_{i}$$. We can use Strassen's algorithm to compute each of these $$k$$ matrix products, and therefore $$B \cdot A$$ can be computed in $$\Theta(k n^{\lg7})$$ time.
