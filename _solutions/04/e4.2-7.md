>Show how to multiply the complex numbers $$a + bi$$ and $$c + di$$ using only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take $$a, b, c, $$ and $$d$$ as input and produce the real component $$ac-bd$$ and the imaginary component $$ad + bc$$ separately.

Recall that $$i^2 = -1$$. In order to obtain our desired output we will reframe the technique Strassen used but in one less dimension:

IMAGINARY-MULTIPLICATION(a, b, c, d)

01 `x = a · c`

02 `y = b · d`

03 `z = (a + b) · (c + d)`

04 `real = x - y`

05 `imaginary = z - x - y`

Which yields:

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{ real} & = x - y \\
& = ac - bd \\
\text{imaginary} & = z - x - y \\
& = ac + ad + bc + bd - ac - bd \\
& = ad + bc \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$
