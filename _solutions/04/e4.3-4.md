>Show that by making a different inductive hypothesis, we can overcome the difficulty with the boundary condition $$T(1) = 1$$ for recurrence (4.19) without adjusting the boundary conditions for the inductive proof.

Recall that (4.19) refers to $$T(n) = 2T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + n$$. Our solution of $$T(n) \leq cn \lg n$$ at the boundary condition yields $$T(1) \leq c \cdot \lg 1 = 0$$ which certainly does not equal $$1$$.

Let us modify our guess to be $$T(n) \leq cn \lg n + n$$. Substituting this into the recurrence yields

$$\begin{split}
T(n) & \leq 2(c \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \lg \lfloor n/2 \rfloor + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + n \\
& \leq cn \lg (n/2) + 2(n/2) + n \\
& = cn \lg n - cn \lg 2n + n \\
& = cn \lg n - cn + 2n \\
& \leq cn \lg n + n \\
\end{split}$$

Where the last step $$cn \lg n - cn + 2n \leq cn \lg n + n$$ holds as long as $$c \geq 1$$. At the boundary condition, this evaluates to $$T(1) \leq cn \lg n + n = c \cdot 1 \cdot \lg 1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$$.
