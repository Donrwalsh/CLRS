>Using the master method in Section 4.5, you can show that the solution to the recurrence $$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n$$ is $$T(n) = \Theta(n^2)$$. Show that a substitution proof with the assumption $$T(n) \leq cn^2$$ fails. then show how to subtract off a lower-order term to make a substitution proof work.

We start by substituting our doomed guess of $$T(n) \leq cn^2$$ into the recurrence

$$\begin{split}
T(n) & \leq 4c \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^2 + n \\
& = 4c \frac{n^2}{4} + n \\
& = cn^2 + n \\
& \leq cn^2 \\
\end{split}$$

Where the last step ($$cn^2 + n \leq cn^2$$) does not hold for any valid value of $$c$$. Next, let us modify our guess to subtract a lower order term: $$T(n) \leq cn^2 - bn$$. Substituting this new guess into the recurrence yields 

$$\begin{split}
T(n) & \leq 4 \left( c \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^2 -b \frac{n}{2} \right) + n \\
& = cn^2 - 2bn + n \\
& \leq cn^2 - bn \\
\end{split}$$

Where the last step holds for $$b \geq 1$$.
