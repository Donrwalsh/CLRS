>***a.*** $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + 1$$

$$a = 2$$, $$b = 4$$ and $$f(n) = 1$$.

Case 1 applies since $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_{4}2-\epsilon}) = O(n^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}})$$, and thus the solution to the recurrence is $$T(n) =  \Theta(n^{\log_{4}2}) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$$.

>***b.*** $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + \sqrt{n}$$

$$a = 2$$, $$b = 4$$ and $$f(n) = \sqrt{n}$$.

Case 1 does not apply since $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_{4}2-\epsilon}) \implies \epsilon = 0$$ 

Case 2 applies since $$f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_{4}2}) = \Theta(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$$, and thus the solution to the recurrence is $$T(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n} \lg n)$$.

>***c.*** $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n$$

$$a = 2$$, $$b = 4$$ and $$f(n) = n$$.

Case 1 does not apply since $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_{4}2 - \epsilon}) \implies \epsilon = - \frac{1}{2}$$.

Case 2 does not apply since $$f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_{4}2}) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$$ does not hold.

Case 3 applies since $$\Omega(n^{\log_{4}2 + \epsilon}) = \Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}})$$ and

$$\begin{split}
a(f(n/b)) & \leq cf(n) \\
2(n/4) & \leq cn \\
\frac{1}{2}n & \leq cn \\
\end{split}$$

holds for $$ \frac{1}{2} \leq c < 1$$. Thus the solution to the recurrence is $$T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) = \Theta(n)$$.

>***d.*** $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n^2$$

Case 1 does not apply since $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_{4}2 - \epsilon}) \implies \epsilon = -\frac{3}{2}$$.

Case 2 does not apply since $$f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_{4}2}) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$$ does not hold.

Case 3 applies since $$\Omega(n^{\log_{4}2 + \epsilon}) = \Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2}})$$ and

$$\begin{split}
a(f(n/b)) & \leq cf(n) \\
2(n^2/4) & \leq cn^2 \\
\frac{1}{2}n^2 & \leq cn^2 \\
\end{split}$$

holds for $$ \frac{1}{2} \leq c < 1$$. Thus the solution to the recurrence is $$T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) = \Theta(n^2)$$.
