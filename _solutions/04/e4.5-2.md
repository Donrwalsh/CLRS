>Professor Caesar wishes to develop a matrix-multiplication algorithm that is asymptotically faster than Strassen's algorithm. His algorithm will use the divide-and-conquer method, dividing each matrix into pieces of size $$n/4 \times n/4$$, and the divide and combine steps together will take $$\Theta(n^2)$$ time. He needs to determine how many subproblems his algorithm has to create in order to beat Strassen's algorithm. If his algorithm creates $$a$$ subproblems, then the recurrence for the running time $$T(n)$$ becomes $$T(n) = aT(n/4) + \Theta(n^2)$$. What is the largest integer value of $$a$$ for which Professor Caesar's algorithm would be asymptotically faster than Strassen's algorithm?

Strassen's algorithm has an asymptotic complexity of $$n^{\log_{2}7}$$ and so we must find the set of values of $$a$$ that beat this time and then select the highest integer among them.

In order to satisfy Case 1, we must choose some integer $$a$$ such that $$a > 4$$ and then the output becomes simply $$\Theta(n^{\log_{4}a})$$. Plotting $$\log_{4}x$$ against $$\log_{2}7$$ shows us the cross-over point is at $$x = 49$$ which indicates that the set of integers we care about is $${5, 48}$$ ([graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cymav1wpds)). Thus the largest integer value of $$a$$ for which Professor Caesar's algorithm is asymptotically faster than Strassen's algorithm is $$48$$.
