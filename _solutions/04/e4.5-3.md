>Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search recurrence $$T(n) = T(n/2) + \Theta(1)$$ is $$T(n) = \Theta(\lg n)$$. (See Exercise 2.3-5 for a description of binary search.)

$$a = 1$$, $$b = 2$$ and $$f(n) = 1$$.

Case 1 does not apply since $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_{2}1 - \epsilon}) \implies \epsilon < -1$$.

Case 2 applies since $$f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_{2}1}) = \Theta(1)$$, and thus the solution to the recurrence is $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_{2}1} \lg n) = \Theta(\lg n)$$.
