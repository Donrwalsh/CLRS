>Consider the regularity condition $$af(n/b) \leq cf(n)$$ for some constant $$c < 1$$, which is part of case 3 of the master theorem. Give an example of constants $$a \leq 1$$ and $$b > 1$$ and a function $$f(n)$$ that satisfies all the conditions in case 3 of the master theorem except the regularity condition.

Setting $$a = 1$$ and $$b = 2$$ gives us the convenient case where our $$f(n)$$ must be $$\Omega(n^{\log_{2}1 + \epsilon}) = \Omega(n^{0+\epsilon})$$. By selecting $$f(n) = n(2- \cos n)$$ we are able to satisfy this condition for some $$\epsilon < 1$$ and our $$f(n)$$ has a graph that looks like this:

The regularity condition requires that for some constant $$c < 1$$ and all sufficiently large $$n$$ that:

$$\begin{split}
af(n/b) & \leq cf(n) \\
1 \cdot \frac{n}{2}\left(2 - \cos \frac{n}{2}\right) & \leq cn(2- \cos n) \\
2 - \cos \frac{n}{2} & \leq 2c(2 - \cos n) \\
2 - \cos \frac{n}{2} & \leq c(4 - 2 \cos n) \\
\frac{2- \cos \frac{n}{2}}{4 - \cos n} & \leq c \\
\end{split}$$

The [graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kmtgk6eiwh) of $$\frac{2- \cos \frac{n}{2}}{4 - \cos n}$$ continues in a repeating pattern indefinitely. This pattern regularly exceeds $$1$$ which means there is no valid value of $$c$$ that satisfies this inequality for sufficiently large values of $$n$$.
