>Give a simple and exact expression for $$n_j$$ in equation (4.27) for the case in which $$b$$ is a positive integer instead of an arbitrary real number.

Equation 4.27 is

$$n_j = 
\begin{cases} 
      n & \text{if } j = 0 \text{,} \\
      \lceil n_{j-1}/b\rceil & \text{if } j > 0 \text{.}\\
   \end{cases}$$

If $$b$$ is a positive integer, we can simplify this expression to be $$n_j = \lceil n/b^j \rceil$$.
