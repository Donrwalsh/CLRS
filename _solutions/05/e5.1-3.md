>Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability $$1/2$$ and 1 with probability $$1/2$$. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some probability $$p$$ and 0 with probability $$1-p$$, where $$0 < p < 1$$, but you do not know what $$p$$ is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability $$1/2$$. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of $$p$$?

The trick is to call BIASED-RANDOM twice which has four possible outcomes with the following probabilities (as per the law of the lazy statistician):

$$\begin{array} {|r|r|}
\hline \text{Outcome} & \text{Probability} \\ 
\hline (0, 0) & (1-p)^2 \\ 
\hline (1, 1) & p^2 \\ 
\hline (1, 0) & p(1-p) \\ 
\hline (0, 1) & (1-p)p \\ 
\hline  
\end{array}$$

We can take advantage of the fact that the last two possibilites have an equal probability of occurring by repeatedly calling BIASED-RANDOM twice until we get one of those two outcomes. For convenience, we will simply take the first value of the outcome as our result.

UNBIASED-RANDOM():

1 `x = BIASED-RANDOM()`

2 `y = BIASED-RANDOM()`

3 `if x == y:`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `return UNBIASED-RANDOM()`

5 `else:`

6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `return x`

Calculating the expected runtime of UNBIASED-RANDOM is best done by treating the procedure as a sequence of Bernoulli trials (described in appendix C.4). The success case is when our two coin filps differ which has a combined probability of $$2p(1-p)$$ of occurring. Therefore the expected runtime can be calculated by way of Formula C.32 and is $$\Theta\left(\frac{1}{2p(1-p)}\right)$$.
