>In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you hire exactly $$n$$ times?

There are $$n!$$ possible candidate orders to consider. If we perform only one hire, this means that the best candidate was in the first position which represents $$(n-1)!$$ of these possible orders. The probability of this happening is therefore $$\frac{(n-1)!}{n!} = \frac{1}{n}$$.

If we perform $$n$$ hires, this means that the candidates were in increasing order which represents just one of these possible orders. The probability of this happening is therefore $$\frac{1}{n!}$$.
