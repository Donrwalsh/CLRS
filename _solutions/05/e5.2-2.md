>In HIRE-ASSITANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you hire exactly twice?

Hiring exactly twice only occurs when a specific pattern is present wherein after we hire the first candidate the next candidate hired is the candidate ranked $$n$$ and so we make no additional hire beyond the second.

So our first candidate must have rank $$i \leq n - 1$$. Let's call this event $$E_i$$, and we know that this event has probability $$\frac{1}{n}$$ for any value of $$i$$.

If the best candidate (rank $$n$$) is at position $$j$$, we are interested in the cases where positions $$2, 3, \dots, j-1$$ have ranks that are less than the rank of candidate $$1$$. Call this event $$F$$. Given that event $$E_i$$ has occurred, event $$F$$ only occurs when the first candidate interviewed out of the $$n - i$$ candidates with ranks $$i+1, i+2, \dots, n$$ is the best candidate. So the conditional probability of $$F$$ occurring given that $$E_i$$ has occurred is $$\frac{1}{n-1}$$.

So the total probability that we hire exactly twice is

$$\begin{split}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} P(E_i) \cdot P(F) & = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{n-i} \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n - i} \\
& = \frac{1}{n} \left( \frac{1}{n-1} + \frac{1}{n-2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1} \right) \\
\end{split}$$

The summation conveniently takes the recognizable form of a harmonic series, and so we can reduce the result to $$\frac{1}{n}H_{n-1}$$ were $$H_{n-1}$$ is the $$n$$th harmonic number.
