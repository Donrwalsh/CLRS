>Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of $$n$$ dice.

Since it is not specified, I must assume the dice in question are 20-sided. Our sample space is $$S = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 20\}$$ with $$Pr\{1\} = Pr\{2\} = \dots = Pr\{20\} = \frac{1}{20}$$. We define our indicator random variable $$X_i$$ associated with the die showing value $$i$$.

The expected value of a dice roll is then

$$\begin{split}
E[X_k] &= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{20} i \cdot Pr{X_k = i} \\
&= \frac{1 + 2 + \dots + 20}{20} \\
&= \frac{230}{20} \\
&= 11.5 \\
\end{split}$$

Rolling $$n$$ dice is a collection of $$n$$ independent events and thus the expected sum is simply $$11.5 \cdot n$$.
