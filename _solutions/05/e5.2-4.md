>Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the **hat-check problem**. Each of $$n$$ customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of customers who get back their own hat?

Let the random variable $$X$$ represent the number of customers that get their hat back and let $$X_i$$ be the indicator random variable that denotes whether customer $$i$$ gets the correct hat back. This implies that $$X = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$$. We will calculate the expected value of $$X$$ to answer this question.

Each indvidual customer has a $$\frac{1}{n}$$ chance of receiving the correct hat back. So $$Pr\{X_i = 1\} = \frac{1}{n} \implies E[X_i] = \frac{1}{n}$$.

$$\begin{split}
E[X] &= E[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} X_i] \\
&= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] \\
&= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} \\
&= 1
\end{split}$$

We therefore expect just one customer to receive back the correct hat.
