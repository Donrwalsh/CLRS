This code does not produce a uniform random permutation.

Unlike the code in [Exercise 5.3-2](/CLRS/solutions/05/e5.3-2), this code can actually produce all random permutations. The trouble comes from the uniform production requirement. Consider the case when $$n = 3$$. We would expect all 6 possible permutations to be equally likely. Within the for loop we are exchanging $$A[i]$$ with one of 3 different possible values, meaning there are $$3^3 = 27$$ possible non-distinct outputs each with a $$\frac{1}{27}$$ chance of ocurring. No matter how the possibilities are distributed, it is not possible to form a $$\frac{1}{6}$$ chance by repeatedly summing $$\frac{1}{27}$$ and so the production cannot be uniform.
