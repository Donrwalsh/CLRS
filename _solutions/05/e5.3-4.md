>Show that each element $$A[i]$$ has a $$\frac{1}{n}$$ probability of winding up in any particular position in $$B$$. Then show that Professor Armstrong is mistaken by showing that the resulting permutation is not uniformly random.

PERMUTE-BY-CYCLIC shifts the array $$A$$ by whatever offset value is generated. Since each value of offset is equally likely, there is a $$\frac{1}{n}$$ chance of each individual value being chosen which directly translates into $$A[i]$$ having a $$\frac{1}{n}$$ chance of winding up in any particular position in $$B$$.

This procedure does not produce a uniform permutation because it can only generate permutations in which the original sequence of values in $$A$$ is retained. So if $$A$$ is $$\{1, 2, 3\}$$ this procedure will only generate three possible outputs: $$\{1, 2, 3\}$$, $$\{2, 3, 1\}$$ and $$\{3, 1, 2\}$$.
