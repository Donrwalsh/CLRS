>Prove that in the array $$P$$ in procedure PERMUTE-BY-SORTING, the probability that all elements are unique is at least $$1 - \frac{1}{n}$$.

Let $$X_i$$ be an indicator random variable for the event that $$P[i]$$ is not unique. $$P[i]$$ being unique means that it holds a different value from the values found in $$P[1, \dots, i-1]$$ which has at most $$i-1$$ distinct elements and so we have $$Pr\{X_i\} = E[X_i] \leq \frac{i-1}{n^3}$$. Let $$X$$ be a random variable for the event that $$P$$ holds at least one duplicate element. This gives us

$$X = (X_1 \cup X_2 \cup \cdots \cup X_n) = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n \textrm{.}$$

We can then calculate

$$\begin{split}
E[X] &= E \left[ \sum\limits^n_{i=1} X_i \right] \\
&= \sum\limits^n_{i=1} E[X_i] \\
& \leq \sum\limits^n_{i=1} \frac{i - 1}{n^3} \\
&= \frac{1}{n^3} \sum\limits^{n-1}_{i=0} i \\
&= \frac{1}{n^3} \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \textit{ //(arithmetic series)} \\
&= \frac{n-1}{2n^2} \\
& \leq \frac{1}{n} \\
\end{split}$$

And so the probability that all elements in $$P$$ are unique is $$E[\bar{X}] = 1 - E[X] \geq 1 - \frac{1}{n}$$.
