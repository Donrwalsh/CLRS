>How many people must there be in a room before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you do is at least $$\frac{1}{2}$$? How many people must there be before the probability that at least two people have a birthday on July 4 is greater than $$\frac{1}{2}$$?

The probability of a single individual having the same birthday as me is $$\frac{1}{365}$$ so the complementary event has probability $$1 - \frac{1}{365} = \frac{364}{365}$$. The probability that none of $$k$$ individuals have the same birthday as me is $$\frac{364^k}{365^k}$$. This probability exceeds $$\frac{1}{2}$$ when $$k \geq \log_{\frac{364}{365}}(\frac{1}{2}) \approx 253$$. So there must must be $$253 + 1$$ people (counting myself) in a room before the probability that someone has the same birthday as me.

It is simpler to calculate the probability that 0 or 1 people have a birthday on July 4 and then take the complement. So the probability that $$k$$ out of $$n$$ people have a birthday on July 4 is $${n \choose k} \frac{364^{n-k}}{365}$$. So when $$k = 0$$ we have $$\frac{364}{365}^n$$ and when $$k = 1$$ we have $$\frac{n364^{n-1}}{365^n}$$. Solving this normally would be pretty obnoxious, so I opted to write a quick python script to determine that the first value of $$n$$ for when the sum of these two values exceeds $$\frac{1}{2}$$ is $$n = 613$$.

{% highlight python %}
x = 1
result = 1
while result > .5:
    result = (((364/365)**x) * (1 + x/364))
    print(str(x) + ": " + str(result))
    x += 1
