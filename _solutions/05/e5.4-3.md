>For the analysis of the birthday paradox, is it important that the birthdays be mutually independent, or is pairwise independence sufficient? Justify your answer.

Pairwise independence is sufficient. We are only ever interested in the independence of two events, which is to say that the probability of two birthdays being on the same day is calculated as the product of two independent events. This does not require the birthdays to be mutually independent.
