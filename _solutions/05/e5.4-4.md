>How many people should be invited to a party in order to make it likely that there are *three* people with the same birthday?

Let $$X_{ijk}$$ be the indicator random variable for the event that the birthdays represented by $$i$$, $$j$$ and $$k$$ are the same. It follows that $$X_{ijk} = \frac{1}{n^2}$$. To calculate the number of people to invite:

$$\begin{split}
E[X] &= E \left[ \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^m \sum\limits_{k=j+1}^m X_{ijk} \right] \\
&= \sum\limits_{i=1}^m \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^m \sum\limits_{k=j+1}^m \frac{1}{n^2} \\
&= {m \choose 3} \frac{1}{n^2} \\
&= \frac{m(m-1)(m-2)}{6n^2} \\
\end{split}$$

And then to solve for $$m$$:

$$\begin{split}
&= \frac{m(m-1)(m-2)}{6(365)^2} \\
6(365)^2 & \leq m(m-1)(m-2) \\
6(133,225) &\leq (m^2 -m)(m-2) \\
799,350 &\leq m^3 - 3m^2 + 2m \\
\end{split}$$

The smallest integer for which this equation holds is $$m = 94$$.
