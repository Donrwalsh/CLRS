>What is the probabiliy that a $$k$$-string over a set of size $$n$$ forms a $$k$$-permutation? How does this question relate to the birthday paradox?

This is the probability that each element of our $$k$$-string is unique, and so this question is complementary to the birthday paradox:

$$\begin{split}
Pr &= 1 \cdot \frac{n-1}{n} \cdot \frac{n-2}{n} \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac{n-k+1}{n} \\
&= \frac{(n-1)!}{(n-k)!n^k} \\
\end{split}$$
