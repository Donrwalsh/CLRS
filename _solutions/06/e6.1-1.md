>What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height $$h$$?

The minimum number of elements for height $$h$$ occurs when $$h$$ contains only one element, and all earlier heights are filled: minimum = $$2^h$$.

The maximum number of elements for height $$h$$ occurs when both $$h$$ and all previous heights are filled: maximum = $$2^{h+1} - 1$$.
