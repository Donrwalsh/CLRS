>Show that an $$n$$-element heap has height $$\lfloor \lg n \rfloor$$.

Based on [Exercise 6.1-1](/CLRS/solutions/06/e6.1-1), a heap of height $$h$$ is a complete tree of height $$h - 1$$ with an additional level that has between $$1$$ and $$2^h$$ nodes. 

$$\begin{split}
2^h & \leq n & \leq 2^{h+1} - 1 \\
2^h & \leq n & < 2^{h+1} \\
\lg(2^h) & \leq \lg n & < \lg (2^{h+1}) \\
h & \leq \lg n & < h + 1 \\
\end{split}$$

Because $$h$$ is an integer, we can say that $$h = \lfloor \lg n \rfloor$$.
