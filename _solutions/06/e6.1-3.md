>Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree.

For all nodes within a subtree $$A$$, the max-heap property tells us that a node $$A[i] \leq A[\text{parent}(i)]$$. Since the root of the subtree is always the topmost parent it must contain the larget value of the entire subtree.
