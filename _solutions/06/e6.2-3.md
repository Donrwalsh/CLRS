>What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY($$A, i$$) when the element $$A[i]$$ is larger than its children?

The procedure runs once and makes no changes to the heap. Specifically, the if check on line 3 fails and so `largest` is set to $$i$$. The if check on line 6 fails and so `largest`'s value is still $$i$$, causing the if check on line 8 to fail and so the procedure terminates without calling itself.
