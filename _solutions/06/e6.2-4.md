>What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY($$A, i$$) for $$i > A.heap-size/2$$?

The procedure runs once and makes no changes to the heap. Specifically, when $$ i > A.heap-size / 2$$, $$i$$ is a leaf (See [Exercise 6.1-7](/CLRS/solutions/06/e6.1-7)) and so both our values for LEFT($$i$$) and RIGHT($$i$$) will exceed A.heap-size. This will cause all three if-checks to fail and the procedure terminates without calling itself.
