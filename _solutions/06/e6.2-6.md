>Show that the worst-case running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a heap of size $$n$$ is $$\Omega(\lg n)$$. (*Hint:* For a heap with $$n$$ nodes, give node values that cause MAX-HEAPIFY to be called recursively at every node on a simple path from the root down to a leaf.)

Suppose $$i = 1$$ and $$A[i]$$ is the smallest value in the entire heap. Calling MAX-HEAPIFY($$A, 1$$) will result in the node at the head being swapped repeatdely until it reaches a leaf (and because we're discussing a worst-case scenario, this leaf will be at the bottom-most level). This means we will perform $$h$$ swaps and since $$h = \lfloor \lg n \rfloor$$, MAX-HEAPIFY has worst-case run time of $$\Omega(\lg n)$$.
