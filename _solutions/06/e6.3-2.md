>Why do we want the loop index $$i$$ in line 2 of BUILD-MAX-HEAP to decrease from $$\lfloor A.length / 2 \rfloor$$ to $$1$$ rather than increase from $$1$$ to $$\lfloor A.length / 2 \rfloor$$?

Reversing the order of the BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure violates the loop invariant that states each node with a higher index than $$i$$ is the root of a max heap.

Suppose we used this new order on the heap from [Exercise 6.3-1](/CLRS/solutions/06/e6.3-1). Acting upon $$A[1]$$ would result in shifting the value $$5$$ to a leaf node on the right side. This is a different location for the node, but doesn't seem problematic. Acting on $$A[2]$$ however, would result in a swap such that $$A[2] = 84$$, but thanks to our first swap we have $$A[1] = 17$$ and so $$A[1] < A[2]$$ and the max heap property is violated.

Thus to use this alternative ordering, we would need to expand our procedure to call MAX-HEAPIFY on parent elements of $$i$$, drastically and unnecessarily increasing the runtime of BUILD-MAX-HEAP.
