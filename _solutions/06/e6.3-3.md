>Show that there are at most $$\lceil n / 2^{h+1} \rceil$$ nodes of height $$h$$ in any $$n$$-element heap.

[Exercise 6.1-7](/CLRS/solutions/06/e6.1-7) showed that the leaves of an $$n$$-element heap are indexed by $$\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 1, \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 2, \dots, n$$. These elements correspond to half of the heap array plus the middle element if there is one. Thus, we know an $$n$$-element heap has $$\lceil n / 2 \rceil$$ leaf nodes, or nodes at height $$h = 0$$. This forms the base case for a proof by induction because at height $$h = 0$$, our claim states that there are at most $$\lceil n / 2^{0+1} \rceil = \lceil n / 2 \rceil$$ nodes.

In order to show that this claim holds for $$n + 1$$, suppose we modify the heap by removing all leaf nodes. Our new heap now has $$n - \lceil n / 2 \rceil$$ nodes. Because $$n$$ is an integer, $$ n - \lceil n / 2 \rceil = \lceil n - n / 2 \rceil = \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$$. Our claim states that there are now $$\left\lceil \frac{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor}{2^{0+1}} \right\rceil$$ nodes at height $$h = 0$$. Based on the conclusions of [Exercise 6.1-7](/CLRS/solutions/06/e6.1-7), an $$\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$$ - element heap has $$\left\lceil \frac{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor}{2^{0+1}} \right\rceil = \lceil \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \rceil = \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor$$ leaf nodes and so we see that this claim holds for all values of $$h$$ and $$n$$.
