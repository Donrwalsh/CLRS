>Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant:
>
>At the start of each iteration of the **for** loop on lines 2-5, the subarray $$A[1\dots i]$$ is a max-heap containing the $$i$$ smallest elements of $$A[1 \dots n]$$, and the subarray $$A[i+1\dots n]$$ contains the $$n - i$$ largest elements of $$A[1\dots n]$$, sorted.

**Initialization**: Immediately prior to the first iteration of the loop we perform BUILD-MAX-HEAP on our heap and the subarray $$A[1\dots i]$$ is in fact the entire heap because $$i = n$$. Therefore $$A[1\dots i]$$ trivially contains the $$i$$ smallest elements of $$A$$, and $$A[i+1\dots n]$$ is empty.

**Maintenance**: Each iteration of the for loop decrements $$i$$ by $$1$$ after shifting the largest element from $$A[i\dots 1]$$ to $$A[i+1\dots n]$$. Because we are always shifting the largest element, it must be true that only the smallest elements remain in $$A[1\dots i]$$. Likewise, $$A[i+1\dots n]$$ represents the $$n-i$$ elements that have already been shifted and so must contain the largest elements of $$A$$ in increasing order.

**Termination**: The loop terminates when $$i=1$$ at which point $$A[1\dots i]$$ contains one element: the smallest element of $$A$$. In addition, we have shifted $$n-1$$ elements into $$A[2\dots n]$$ which are the $$n-1$$ largest elements of $$A$$ in increasing order. Thus $$A$$ is sorted.
