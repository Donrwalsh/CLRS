>What is the running time of HEAPSORT on an array $$A$$ of length $$n$$ that is already sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing order?

The initial ordering of the input array does not change the overall runtime of HEAPSORT. The call to BUILD-MAX-HEAP still takes $$\Theta(n)$$ time as the initial order only impacts this runtime by a constant factor which is ignored.

At this point the two cases converge since our array is now a max heap in both cases. The inner lines of the for loop may end up traversing the entire height of the heap and thus take $$\Theta(\lg n)$$ time. Because of the loop itself, we are performing these steps $$n$$ times and so the total run time (in both cases) is $$\Theta(n \lg n) + \Theta(n) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$.
