>Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size $$n$$ is $$\Theta(n)$$.

The primary for loop examines each element of the $$n$$-element array $$A[p..r]$$ once. In the best case, no action is taken on any element but we still need to examine each one. In the worst-case, a constant time action is performed on each element and so the run time of  PARTITION on an $$n$$-element array is $$\Theta(n)$$.
