>What is the running time of QUICKSORT when all elements of array $$A$$ have the same value?

This case represents a worst-case scenario for the running of QUICKSORT because the $$A[p..q-1]$$ will always contain all the found elements, while the $$A[q+1..r]$$ partition will be empty. The runtime in this case is $$\Theta(n^2)$$ as outlined in the text.
