>What is the smallest possible depth of a leaf in a decision tree for a comparison sort?

This leaf represents the best case in which we perform the least number of comparisons to determine a proper sort order. For an input sequence of $$n$$ elements, the best case requires $$n-1$$ comparisons. Thus a decision tree's leaves would have depths of at at least $$n-1$$ which correspond to this best case.
