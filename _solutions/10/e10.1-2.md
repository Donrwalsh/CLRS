>Explain how to implement two stacks in one array $$A[1...n]$$ in such a way that neither stack overflows unless the total number of elements in both stacks together is $$n$$. The PUSH and POP operations should run in $$O(1)$$ time.

Have one stack begin at $$A[1]$$ with the top position increasing when values are pushed and decreasing on the POP operation.

Have the second stack begin at $$A[n]$$ with the top position decreasing when values are pushed and increasing on the POP operation.

Finally, have the array throw a stack overflow error when a PUSH operation would cause both top values to be equal.
