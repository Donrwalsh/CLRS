>Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end, and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a ***deque*** (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four $$O(1)$$-time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a dequeue implemented by an array.

ENQUEUE-TAIL(Q, x)

1 `if Q.tail + 1 == Q.head or (Q.tail == Q.length and Q.head == 1):`

2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`error "overflow"`

3 `Q[Q.tail] = x`

4 `if Q.tail == Q.length:`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Q.tail = 1`

6 `else Q.tail = Q.tail + 1`

ENQUEUE-HEAD(Q, x)

1 `if Q.tail + 1 == Q.head or (Q.tail == Q.length and Q.head == 1):`

2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`error "overlow"`

3 `if Q.head == 1:`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Q.head = Q.length`

5 `else Q.head = Q.head - 1`

6 `Q[Q.head] = x`

DEQUEUE-TAIL(Q)

1 `if Q.tail == Q.head:`

2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`error "underflow"`

3 `if Q.tail == 1:`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Q.tail = Q.length`

5 `else Q.tail = Q.tail - 1`

6 `return Q[Q.tail]`

DEQUEUE-HEAD(Q)

1 `if Q.tail == Q.head:`

2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`error "underflow"`

3 `x = Q[Q.head]`

4 `if Q.head == Q.length:`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Q.head = 1`

6 `else Q.head = Q.head + 1`

7 `return x`
