> Can you implement the dynamic-set operation INSERT on a singly linked list in $$O(1)$$ time? How about DELETE?

SINGLY-LINKED-LIST-INSERT(L, x)

1 `x.next = L.head`

2 `L.head = x`

SINGLY-LINKED-LIST-DELETE(L, x)

1 `if x.next == NIL:`

2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`findTail = head`

3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`while findTail.next ≠ x:`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`findTail = findTail.next`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`findTail.next = NIL`

6 `else:`

7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`x.key = x.next.key`

8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`x.next = x.next.next`

SINGLY-LINKED-LIST-INSERT runs in $$\Theta(1)$$ constant time. SINGLY-LINKED-LIST-DELETE runs in constant time for all cases except when the given value of $$x$$ is the tail of list $$L$$ in which case we must find $$x$$'s previous element which means this operation takes $$\Theta(n)$$ linear time. (Note that by the text's definition, the tail must have a next value of NIL, so setting $$x$$'s key value to NIL is not sufficient to correctly delete the $$x$$ node)
