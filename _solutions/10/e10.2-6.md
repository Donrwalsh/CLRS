> The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ as input, and it returns a set $$S = S_1 \cup S_2$$ consisting of all the elements of $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$. The sets $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ are usually destroyed by the operation. Show how to support UNION in $$O(1)$$ time using a suitable list data structure.

Suppose that both $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ are circular, doubly linked lists with sentinels. To perform a UNION operation on these two lists we do the following:

UNION-OPERATION-ON-CIRCULAR-DOUBLY-LINKED-LISTS-WITH-SENTINELS(x, y)

1 `x.NIL.prev = y.tail`

2 `y.tail.next = x.NIL`

3 `x.tail.next = y.NIL.next`

4 `y.NIL.next.prev = x.tail`

Calling this procedure on $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$ effectively concatenates them together and removes the sentinel value from $$S_2$$ so that there is only one sentinel value in the resulting doubly linked circular list.
