> Give a $$\Theta(n)$$-time nonrecursive procedure that reverses a singly linked list of $$n$$ elements. The procedure should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself.

REVERSE-SINGLY-LINKED-LIST(x)

1 `a = x.head`

2 `b = x.head.next`

3 `while b != NIL:`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `c = b.next`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `b.next = a`

6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `a = b`

7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `b = c`

8 `x.head = a`
