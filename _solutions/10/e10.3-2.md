> Write the procedures ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT for a homogeneous collection of objects implemented by the single-array representation.

These procedures end up looking very similar to how they are written in the textbook, just with different syntax since we are dealing with a single array. Noting that we access the _next_ value of the _i_-th object within $$A$$ as $$A[i + 1]$$, we have:

ALLOCATE-OBJECT()

1 `if free == NIL`

2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `error "out of space"`

3 `else x = free`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `free = A[x + 1]`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `return x`

FREE-OBJECT(x)

1 `A[x + 1] = free`

2 `free = x`
