> Why don't we need to set or reset the _prev_ attributes of objects in the implementation of the ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT procedures?

We can safely leave any relevant _prev_ attributes alone during these procedures because we know these values won't ever be used. When freeing an object we use the _next_ attribute to maintain the stack-like properties of $$free$$ and when allocating an object we simply return the node ready to accept real values. Therefore both of these procedures behave the same whether or not any _prev_ values are present.
