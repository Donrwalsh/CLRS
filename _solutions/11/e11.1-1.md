>Suppose that a dynamic set $$S$$ is represented by a direct-address table $$T$$ of length $$m$$. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of $$S$$. What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?

FIND-MAXIMUM(S)

1 `max = NIL`

2 `for i = 0 to m-1:`

3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`val=DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH(T, i)`

4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if val > max:`

5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`max = val`

6 `return max`

We must examine $$m$$ distinct values because any key of $$T$$ may contain the maximum. Therefore this procedure runs in $$O(m)$$ time in the worst case.
