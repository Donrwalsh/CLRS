> Suppose that we are storing a set of $$n$$ keys into a hash table of size $$m$$. Show that if the keys are drawn from a universe $$U$$ with $$\lvert U \rvert > nm$$, then $$U$$ has a subset of size $$n$$ consisting of keys that all hash to the same slot, so that the worst-case searching time for hashing with chaining is $$\Theta(n)$$.

This can be solved using a tight-pigeonhole argument. If $$m-1$$ slots contain at most $$n-1$$ elements then the remaining slots must have at least $$n$$ keys. These $$n$$ keys all hash to the same slot, resulting in a worst-case $$\Theta(n)$$ search time with chaining.

In other words, our remaining slot count is:

$$\begin{equation}
\lvert U \rvert -(m-1)(n-1)>nm-(m-1)(n-1)=n+m-1\geq n
\end{equation}$$
