> Suppose that we hash a string of r characters into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. We can easily represent the number m as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words of storage outside the string itself?

Calculate the value of the first character mod $$m$$. Calculate the value of the second character added to the first mod $$m$$. Continue as such until all $$r$$ characters have been calculated and added to the rolling mod sum.
