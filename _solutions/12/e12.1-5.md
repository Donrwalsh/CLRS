>Argue that since sorting $$n$$ elements takes $$\Omega(n \log n)$$ time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of $$n$$ elements takes $$\Omega(n \log n)$$ time in the worst case.

Suppose we had a comparison-based algorithm that generated a binary search tree faster than $$\Omega(n \log n)$$. Performing an in-order walk of a binary search tree takes $$\Theta(n)$$ time and so we could combine this hypothetical approach with an in-order walk to sort $$n$$ elements in somewhere between $$\Theta(n)$$ and $$\Omega(n \log n)$$ time. Unfortunately, this is in direct contradiction with Theorem 8.1 which stipulates that there is no comparison-based algorithm that can sort $$n$$ elements in faster than $$\Omega(n \log n)$$ time. Thus any comparison-based algorithm that constructs a binary search tree must do so in $$\Omega(n \log n)$$ time in the worst case.
