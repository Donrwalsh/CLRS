>Suppose that we have numbers between 1 and 1000 in a binary search tree, and we want to search for the number 363. Which of the following sequences could *not* be the sequence of nodes examined?
>
>***a.*** 2, 252, 401, 398, 330, 344, 397, 363.
>
>***b.*** 924, 220, 911, 244, 898, 258, 362, 363.
>
>***c.*** 925, 202, 911, 240, 912, 245, 363.
>
>***d.*** 2, 399, 387, 219, 266, 382, 381, 278, 363.
>
>***e.*** 935, 278, 347, 621, 299, 392, 358, 363.

***c*** -> In step 3 we go from 911 to 240 which means we take the left path. In the very next step we hit 912 which cannot be contained in a left subtree of the 911 node.

***e*** -> After taking the right path from 347 we encounter the value 299 which cannot be contained in a right subtree of the 347 node.

All other sequences are valid.
