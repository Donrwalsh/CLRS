>Professor Bunyan thinks he has discovered a remarkable property of binary search trees. Suppose that the search for key $$k$$ in a binary search tree ends up in a leaf. Consider three sets: $$A$$, the keys to the left of the search path; $$B$$, the keys on the search path; and $$C$$, the keys to the right of the search path. Professor Bunyan claims that any three keys $$a \in A$$, $$b \in B$$, and $$c \in C$$ must satisfy $$ a \leq b \leq c$$. Give a smallest possible counterexample to the professor's claim.

In this example, we are searching for key $$k = 1$$ and the shaded nodes represent our path from root to leaf. This search path gives us $$A = \{\}$$, $$B = \{4, 2, 1\}$$ and $$C = \{3\}$$. Because $$3 < 4$$, Professor Bunyan's claim that $$a \leq b \leq c$$ does not hold.

The following LaTeX code was used to generate the above binary search tree:

{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass[border = 5pt, tikz]{standalone}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
  every node/.style = {minimum width = 2em, draw, circle},
  shade/.style = {fill=black!15},
  level/.style = {sibling distance = 30mm/#1}
  ]
  \node [shade] {4}
  child {node [shade] {2}
        child {node [shade] {1}}
        child {node {3}}
        }
  child {edge from parent[draw = none]};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}
