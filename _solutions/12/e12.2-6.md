>Consider a binary search tree $$T$$ whose keys are distinct. Show that if the right subtree of a node $$x$$ in $$T$$ is empty and $$x$$ has a successor $$y$$, then $$y$$ is the lowest ancestor of $$x$$ whose left child is also an ancestor of $$x$$. (Recall that every node is its own ancestor.)

Because $$T$$ contains $$y$$, the successor to $$x$$, we know that some ancestor of $$x$$ (perhaps $$x$$ itself) will be the left child of some parent node $$z$$. We will use mathematical induction to show that $$z$$ must be the successor to $$x$$ and therefore $$z = y$$.

In the base case, $$z$$ is the parent node of $$x$$, and $$x$$ is $$z$$'s left child. Suppose $$z \neq y$$, then there must be some $$y$$ that satisfies $$x < y < z$$. This implies that this $$y$$ must exist in a left subtree of $$z$$ and in a right subtree of $$x$$, but we know $$x$$ does not have a right subtree. Therefore $$z = y$$, or in other words, $$z$$ is the successor to $$x$$.

The other possibility is that $$x$$ is a right child of its parent node, say $$a_1$$. Suppose this first ancestor of $$x$$ is a left child of its parent node $$z$$ and suppose also that $$z \neq y$$. Then there must be some $$y$$ that satisfies $$a_1 < y < z$$. The same argument as the base case applies, but $$a_1$$ has a right-subtree! Indeed, we still know that $$x$$ remains the maximum value of that right subtree and so we confirm that $$z$$ must be the successor of $$x$$. That is, $$z = y$$.

Furhtermore, suppose there are $$n$$ ancestors, $$a_1, a_2, ... a_n$$ between $$x$$ and $$z$$. $$a_1$$ has right child $$x$$ and parent $$a_2$$. $$a_2$$ has right child $$a_1$$ and parent $$a_3$$ and so on until $$a_n$$ has parent $$z$$ which it is a left child of. All of these ancestors share the same property that was described for $$a_1$$: the maximum value of their right subtree is $$x$$ and thus the parent node of $$a_n$$ must be $$x$$'s successor. Once again, $$z = y$$, and thus the claim is shown to be accurate for all possible configurations of the tree.
