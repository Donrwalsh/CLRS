>An alternative method of performing an inorder tree walk of an $$n$$-node binary search tree finds the minimum element in the tree by calling TREE-MINIMUM and then making $$n - 1$$ calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR. Prove that this algorithm runs in $$\Theta(n)$$ time.

By its nature an inorder tree walk will traverse the entire binary search tree, so we know our lower bound must be $$\Omega(n)$$.

This particular approach will visit some nodes more than once but will never travel the same edge more than twice. Consider the two possible 'movements' this traversal can make:

1. The minimum movement: Any time a node has an untraversed right subtree (or at the start of this procedure) we move along the left-most border edges to reach the subtree's minimum value.
2. The return movement: A node with no right subtree produces this movement wherein we step to the node's parent and repeat until we have stepped to the parent of a left-child.

These two movements represent a process of traversing every node in the tree by crossing most edges twice (The edge connected to the tree's maximum leaf node value is only traversed once). Since an $$n$$-node binary search tree has $$n - 1$$ edges this gives our $$n - 1$$ calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR an upper bound of $$O(n)$$.

These two bounds combine to give us a $$\Theta(n)$$ runtime for this alternative inorder tree walk method.
