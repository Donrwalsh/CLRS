>Prove that no matter what node we start at in a height-$$h$$ binary search tree, $$k$$ successive calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR take $$O(k + h)$$ time.

Consider a startng node $$a$$ and an ending node $$b$$ where $$b$$ is $$a$$'s $$k$$ᵗʰ successor. As discussed in [Exercise 12.2-7](/CLRS/solutions/12/e12.2-7) each of the $$k$$ nodes separating $$a$$ and $$b$$ will be visited at most twice. Any node that is not between $$a$$ and $$b$$ will be visited at most once, and there cannot be more than $$h$$ such nodes. Thus the runtime is bounded by $$3k+2h = O(k + h)$$.
