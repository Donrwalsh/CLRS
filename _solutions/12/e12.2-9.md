>Let $$T$$ be a binary search tree whose keys are distinct, let $$x$$ be a leaf node, and let $$y$$ be its parent. Show that $$y.key$$ is either the smallest key in $$T$$ larger than $$x$$.key or the largest key in $$T$$ is smaller than $$x.key$$.

Suppose $$x$$ is a right-child of $$y$$. If we call TREE-SUCCESSOR($$y$$), we end up seeking the minimum value of $$y$$'s right subtree which gives us $$x$$. Thus $$x$$ is $$y$$'s successor, or in other words, $$y.key$$ is the largest key in $$T$$ smaller than $$x.key$$.

Next, suppose $$x$$ is a left-child of $$y$$. If we call TREE-PREDECESSOR($$y$$) (see [Exercise 12.2-3](/CLRS/solutions/12/e12.2-3)), we end up seeking the maximum value of $$x$$'s left subtree which gives us $$y$$. Thus $$x$$ is $$y$$'s predecessor, or in other words, $$y.key$$ is the smallest key in $$T$$ larger than $$x.key$$.
