>We can sort a given set of $$n$$ numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers (using TREE-INSERT repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?

(Note that calling TREE-INSERT on a tree of height $$x$$ takes $$\Theta(x)$$ time and an inorder tree walk on a binary search tree with $$y$$ nodes takes $$\Theta(y)$$ time.)

In the worst-case, our set of $$n$$ numbers is already sorted in which case the $$n$$ successive calls to TREE-INSERT produce a binary search tree of height $$n$$. The runtime in this secnario is $$\Theta(n^2 + n) = \Theta(n^2)$$.

In the best-case, successive calls to TREE-INSERT on our set of $$n$$ numbers produces a balanced tree such that the height does not exceed $$\lg n$$. In this case, the runtime is $$\Theta(n \lg n + n) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$.
