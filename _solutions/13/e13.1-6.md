>What is the largest possible number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with black-height $$k$$? What is the smallest possible number?

Largest is a red-black tree with alternating levels of red nodes and black nodes which is a complete tree of height $$2k$$ and so contains $$2^{2k} - 1$$ internal nodes.

Smallest is a red-black tree with all black nodes which is a complete tree of height $$k$$ and so contains $$2^{k} - 1$$ internal nodes.
