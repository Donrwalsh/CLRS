>Argue that in every $$n$$-node binary search tree, there are exactly $$n - 1$$ possible rotations

For each node in a binary search tree we can call LEFT-ROTATE on it if it has a right child and RIGHT-ROTATE if it has a left child. In effect, each rotate call requires some pair of nodes that have a parent-child relationship. A binary search tree with $$n$$ nodes has $$n - 1$$ such relationships because the root has no parent and thus there are $$n-1$$ possible rotations within such a tree.
