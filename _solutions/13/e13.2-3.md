>Let $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ be arbitrary nodes in subtrees $$\alpha$$, $$\beta$$, and $$\gamma$$, respectively, in the right tree of Figure 13.2. How do the depths of $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ change when a left rotation is performed on node $$x$$ in the figure?

$$a$$ increases by 1, $$b$$ stays the same and $$c$$ decreases by 1.
