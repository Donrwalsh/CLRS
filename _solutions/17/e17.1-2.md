> Show that if a DECREMENT operation were included in the $$k$$-bit counter example, $$n$$ operations could cost as much as $$\Theta(nk)$$ time.

The most costly scenario for DECREMENT is when the counter shows a one followed by $$k-1$$ zeros which involves changing all $$k$$ bits to produce a zero followed by $$k-1$$ ones. Running INCREMENT on that scenario results in the reverse action: changing all $$k$$ bits back to a one followed by $$k-1$$ zeros. Thus if we alternate between DECREMENT and INCREMENT $$n$$ times, we have a worst-case running time of $$\Theta(nk)$$.
