>Why don't we allow a minimum degree of $$t = 1$$?

Consider a hypothetical non-empty B-tree with $$t = 1$$. By property 5a, the root node has at least one key. Additionally, every node has at least $$t-1$$ keys and since B-tree nodes cannot have 0 keys without being considered a leaf, we know each non-leaf node has at least one key. Property 5b says each node may contain at most $$2t-1$$ key and at most $$2t$$ children. So our $$t = 1$$ B-tree has at most $$1$$ key and $$2$$ children.

Thus $$t=1$$ is basically describing a form of binary search tree and includes no specifications that cannot also be reached by setting $$t=2$$. Because of this, and the fact that $$t=1$$ inaccuratly includes minimum caes that cannot exist, we need not allow $$t$$ values less than 2.
