> For what values of $$t$$ is the tree of Figure 18.1 a legal B-tree?

By definition (5a, 5b), every non-root node must have at least $$t - 1$$ keys and every node may have at most $$2t-1$$ keys. The tree in Figure 18.1 has a root node with a single key, and then every other node has 2 or 3 keys. So $$2t-1 \ge 3$$ and $$t - 1 \le 2$$ which means the **_minimum degree_** $$t$$ of this tree can be either 2 or 3.
