> Give three feasible solutions to the linear program in (29.24)-(29.28). What is the objective value of each one?

$$ \bar{x}_1 = (1, 1, 1)$$

$$ \bar{x}_2 = (0, 0, 0)$$

$$ \bar{x}_3 = (3, 2, 1)$$

$$ \bar{x}_1$$ has an objective value of 2, $$ \bar{x}_2$$ has an objective value of 0 and $$\bar{x}_3$$ has an objective value of 3.
