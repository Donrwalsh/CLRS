> Prove that if $$a > b > 0$$ and $$c = a + b$$, then $$c \text{ mod } a = b$$.

Mathematically:

$$
\begin{align*}
c \text{ mod } a &= (a + b) \text{ mod } a \\
&= a \text{ mod } a + b \text{ mod } a \\
&= 0 + b \\
&= b
\end{align*}
$$

This conclusion also follows from a careful reading of Theorem 31.1 which defines the concept of a **_remainder_** as follows:

For any integer $$a$$ and any positive integer $$n$$, there exist unique integers $$q$$ and $$r$$ such that $$0 \le r < n$$ and $$a = qn + r$$. The value $$q = \lfloor \frac{a}{n} \rfloor$$ is the **_quotient_** of the division. The value $$r = a \text{ mod } n$$ is the **_remainder_** of the divison.

So in our case, $$c \text{ mod } a = b$$ is simply a restating of the core remainder concept with differently labeled variables.
